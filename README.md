## What?

Goals:
- Better improve understanding of Golang
- Become more comfortable using Golang as opposed to Python for many automation and tooling tasks.


How:
- Write things I would normally do in Python but with Golang, learn to implement HTTP requests, interact with APIs, and solve basic automation tasks.
- Either develop ideas I have on the fly or re-write projects I've seen for the sake of learning.
